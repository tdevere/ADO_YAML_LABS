# âœ… FIXED - SCENARIO 5A: TRIGGER SYNTAX ERRORS
# Fixes: Proper trigger syntax, resolved schedule conflicts, valid branch patterns

# Fixed: Use branches block for CI triggers (fixes simple list syntax that fails with includes/excludes)
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - develop

# Fixed: PR triggers require branches block (fixes invalid list/mapping mix in error file)
pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - develop
      - feature/*

# Fixed: Remove conflicting branch filters in schedules (fixes include/exclude same branch error)
# Uncommented and corrected: No conflicting filters; removed always: true to prevent forced runs
schedules:
  - cron: "0 2 * * 1-5"
    displayName: 'Daily build'
    branches:
      include:
        - main

# Fixed: Standard variables (no changes needed from error file)
variables:
  buildConfig: 'Release'

# Fixed: Use self-hosted agent pool to avoid hosted parallelism limits
pool:
  name: 'Default'

# Fixed: Simple job structure (focus on trigger fixes; no complex logic needed)
jobs:
  - job: Build
    displayName: 'Simple Build'
    steps:
      - script: echo "Building on corrected triggers"
